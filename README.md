Input:
The input to our algorithm is a string called text.
Method Definition:
We define a method called reverseText that takes a single argument, which is the input string text.
The method returns a string.
Creating a StringBuilder Object:
Inside the reverseText method, we create a new StringBuilder object.
We pass the original text to the StringBuilder constructor.
Reversing the Characters:
We call the reverse() method on the StringBuilder object.
This method reverses the characters in the StringBuilder.
Converting Back to String:
Finally, we convert the reversed StringBuilder back to a regular string using the toString() method.
The reversed string is stored in the variable reversed.
Output:
The reversed string is returned as the output of the reverseText method.
Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the steps:

Create a StringBuilder with the original text.
Reverse the characters using reverse().
Convert the reversed StringBuilder back to a regular string
